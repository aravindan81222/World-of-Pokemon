Hi Rory,
My apologies, Our API access token's are verified that they cannot run in parallel for the same user tokens which apply for all other endpoints too.
Solution: Register as two different users when using separate applications to avoid such interruptions. 
Hope this answer helps you out. Feel free to reach us if any queries further.
Kind Regards,
Team Truelayer
